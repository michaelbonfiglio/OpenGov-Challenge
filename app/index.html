          <h4>Interface Design</h4>
          <p>To begin this, I took a look at multiple small governments to get a sense of what departments are out there. From that I learned that departments are not standard across municipalities. I saw a range in number from 6-15 for towns and small cities. States have more — New York lists <a href="https://www.ny.gov/agencies">100 agencies</a>. I designed a manual entry UI, but I wanted to just add a note about the high number of state departments because they made me consider whether accessing the admin’s address book might expedite the process. The slideshow above has the high fidelity mocks, below I talk in more detail about certain elements and the decisions behind them.</p>

          <h4>User Flow</h4>
         </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p>The interface would require a list of the users (invitees), an action to create a user, fields for the users info, a way to edit, delete and save, and a call to send. For the user flow I tried to catalogue all the potential pathways and actions a user would need to take for this interface to be successful as well as be mindful of the micro-interactions that would follow from the top level choices. While I was designing I came across several moments where I felt some testing would be appropriate, specifically with some of the "are you sure" checks I planned into the flow. I think there’s room for those to either prove necessary or superfluous.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p class="small"> <span class="number">Left Panel</span> I noticed the use of a left-hand panel on the Dashboard and Reports pages. I thought it could be a useful navigation column for this set-up wizard process, allowing the user to see the what step they were on. </p>
       
            <p class="small"> <span class="number">Header Row</span> While the examples of charts I saw had the header row in a bolded title case, I felt the shift was on the subtle side and the hierarchy would benefit from a darker grey value for that level to add more depth between the headings and the user text.</p>
        
        
            <p class="small"> <span class="number">Call to Actions</span> I experimented with the Add User and Send Invitation button placements. At first, I put them next to one another to keep the page controls together, but I didn’t want one getting hit accidentally. Ultimately, I separated them having the Add User button close to the user list and pulling the Send button to the bottom to make it clearer that it’s the “next” button. </p>
       
       
            <p class="small"> <span class="number">Role</span> I toyed with the idea of including a field for the persons actual title as well as the department head role which semantically could differ but ultimately I felt this process would benefit from being as simple as possible and the invited person could fill in any of that detail when they made an account. </p>
            <p class="small">I gave some thought to whether multiple people could be assigned to the same role, and decided that should be allowed. I felt that if OpenGov is creating the department names, there might not be a one to one match, and certain municipalities could be creating different divisions of labor that pertain to the same data. I also thought that in general smaller communities tend to have more shared responsibilities and thus might need that flexibility. I also thought about the reverse, one user being assigned multiple roles. From the prompt of this exercise, I gathered that the primary purpose of this step was to get users started on on-boarding, and that specific roles and permissions on the platform were secondary and could be dealt with later.</p>

            <p class="small"> <span class="number">Modal</span> I originally thought to have the add user portion be either it’s own page or a pop up. But upon further thought I decided if an invitation could operate with the minimal information of name, email or phone, and title, then going to another page or having a modal created an extraneous step to add the info. The list view could allow for both adding and seeing all the names at once, which I think would be helpful to the user. </p>

            <p class="small"> <span class="number">Buttons</span> I tried a few treatments of the control buttons for the invitees. First, attempting to closely replicate the style guide examples, then, trying a few styling options with the type buttons. I tried pairing them down, and removing the delete button in edit mode. Ultimately the solution in the mocks above is the solution I thought looked the best and was clearest.</p>

          <h4>Mobile</h4>
          <p>I wasn’t sure how realistic it would be to complete this set-up wizard on mobile but I thought it would be good to at least consider how it would work, and how the interface would translate to an app.</p>
